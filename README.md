<h2>Welcome to M&E!</h2>
<p>Meet and Eat(M&E) is an app designed to allow users to organize meet-ups with friends to get a bite to eat. This application addresses the fundamental need of social interaction during meals. Our primary user group are students attending university. Average age of the user group is 18-21. If the application were to be successful with students, the user group may be extended to include similar user groups such as employees in a workplace. This will be a mobile application, possibly implemented on the Android platform. The application allows user to plan meetups using scales such as time, date and location preferences. See project overview for more about M&E! Thanks for listening!
